etcdfs
======

This is a toy implementation of etcd + FUSE to provide a filesystem
backed by etcd.  I wouldn't expect this to be a truly useful system
for anything except maybe keeping small config-related directories
in sync between systems (by way of etcd).  Large files don't belong
in etcd, and therefore wouldn't belong in etcdfs.

It works, but it only provides read-only access.  It also has 
hardcoded metadata, such ACLs, ownership, timestamps, etc.


## What Works ##

* Read access
* Directory listings
* File output from the etcd value


## TODO ##

* Read/write access
* Store metadata in etcd (ACL, timeotamps, ownership, etc)
* ...
